This interactive game uses asynchronous code to change the scores when the players roll certain numbers. An ending score can be entered in the text box below. Pressing enter after typing the final score will cause the game to end when a player reaches the score entered. Rolling either a one or a consecutive six will cause the current player's turn to end while the accumulated score is reset to zero. To transfer control to the other player while maintaining the accumulated score, the hold button can be pressed. After the game is complete, the game can be re-initialized to play again.
